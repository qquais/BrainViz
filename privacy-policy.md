# BrainViz - Privacy Policy

BrainViz does not collect, store, or share any personal user data.

The extension is designed to run locally in the browser and only processes EEG files (.edf, .txt) that the user manually uploads. All data stays on the user's machine or is sent to the BrainViz server solely for the purpose of generating EEG visualizations.

We do not access, collect, transmit, or sell any personally identifiable information.

If you have any questions about this policy, contact: [qurratul.quais@gmail.com]
